# RandomCode
This is the folder for most of the projects I'm working on right now.

## Google
I'm developing an app that can recognize Japanese words in a picture and make a word lists in its database. Currently only partly on Python.

## ML
This is the deep-learning projects. Most of the existing ones are on image generation using GAN (Generative Adverserial Network) and VAE (Variational Autoencoders) 
I have wrote [wiki](https://github.com/Fishest/RandomCode/wiki) about the approaches I took and the problems I ran into when doing these research.

## Notebooks
Part of the notebook are from the summer internship I had at Tokyo. Thanks to Paul and Tomoaki!!!!!!! Others are playground to test out the correctness of the random code.
